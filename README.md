# HSV-Range-Object-Tracking
English
The code helps you to find the correct range of HSV color range to track objects by that their color is included in the range. 
It contains 5 parts. Three of them are for displaying the camera (frame, mask, and result). Two other windows exist. one of them is for converting the BGR color type to HSV color type. The other one is for choosing the range of HSV.
This code helps you to choose the range very fast and you do not need to write a code to check what range is good for tracking the object and wast lots of times.
